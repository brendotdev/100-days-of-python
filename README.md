# 🐍 100 Days of Python

A self-paced journey through 100 hands-on Python projects — building, breaking, and learning one day at a time.

## 🌟 About the Project

This repository is a comprehensive log of my journey through the "100 Days of Python" challenge. Each day features a new project, ranging from beginner to intermediate-level applications in:

- ✅ Core Python syntax & logic  
- ✅ Data structures and OOP  
- ✅ GUI development with `Tkinter`  
- ✅ API consumption & automation  
- ✅ Games, tools, and web scraping  
- ✅ Data analysis with `pandas`  
- ✅ Real-world app development  

---

## 🧭 Structure

Each day has its own folder:


Inside each folder:
- `main.py` – the core script for the project  
- Additional files (images, data, modules) as needed  
- Git commits are atomic, descriptive, and track project progression
